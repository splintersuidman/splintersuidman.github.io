I am a Master’s student of [Mathematical Sciences](https://www.uu.nl/en/masters/mathematical-sciences) at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en), The Netherlands.
My mathematical interests include homotopy type theory, algebraic topology, and (higher) category theory.

Previously, I obtained a double Bachelor’s degree in [Mathematics](https://www.ru.nl/en/education/bachelors/mathematics) and [Computing Science](https://www.ru.nl/en/education/bachelors/computing-science) at [Raboud University](https://www.ru.nl/) in Nijmegen, The Netherlands.
My Bachelor’s thesis project, titled [‘Equivariant homotopy theory via orbits’](/files/equivariant-homotopy-theory-via-orbits.pdf), was in algebraic topology (specifically equivariant homotopy theory) and was supervised by Dr Magdalena Kędziorek.
